## Considerations
* You have two weeks to resolve it.
* The parking lot has a garage for 100 vehicles.
* Each car that enters and leaves the parking lot pays a price of $ 115 per hour.
* If the parking capacity reaches the limit, no more revenue should be allowed.
* You can check at any time the number of vehicles that are parked and the number of places available.
* You will also be able to consult the total that has been invoiced, the list of the patents of the vehicles that are inside the parking lot, ordered by date and time of entry.
